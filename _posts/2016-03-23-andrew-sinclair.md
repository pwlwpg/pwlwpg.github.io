<div id="abstract">
The tools of molecular biology were used to solve an instance of the directed Hamiltonian path problem. A small graph was encoded in molecules of DNA, and the "operations" of the computation were performed with standard protocols and enzymes. This experiment demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out computations at the molecular level.

[Andrew Sinclair](https://twitter.com/Andy_CDandy) enjoys many aspects of Computer Science including algorithms, languages, and programming challenges. He prefers to use a good ol' text editor and regular expressions when they will suffice to solve a problem. While away from the computer, he is often found tabletop gaming and going to user groups. Andrew is passionate about gratuitous use of hotkeys and macros.
