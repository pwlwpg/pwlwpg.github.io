This presentation will discuss the PhD thesis of a blind computer science researcher who built a system to assist with his computer use. The ASTER system facilitates the reading and navigation of electronic documents as audio documents, extracting their semantics to inform the rendering of audio. We will also discuss how this project has progressed into its current form in the twenty three years since publication.

[Mak Kolybabi](http://mogigoma.com/) is the founder of several community organizations and works in information security. Mak has a healthy interest in accessibility and an unhealthy interest in Emacs, both of which he'll cover in this talk.
