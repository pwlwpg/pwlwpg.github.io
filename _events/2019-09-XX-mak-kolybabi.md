This talk will cover the paper that introduced the world to ZFS, a modern filesystem that was designed to be less annoying than its predecessors, while taking advantage of the characteristics of modern storage devices. ZFS is supported on several current Unix operating systems. It provides strong data integrity guarantees, large maximum capacity, and a wide variety of storage possibilities. It's the kind of operating system feature that once you acclimate to it, the alternatives begin to look like weak sauce.

[Mak Kolybabi](http://mogigoma.com/) is the (co-)founder of several community organizations in Winnipeg — SkullSpace, The Long Con, Papers We Love, DC204, Nepharia — and works in information security. Mak has a healthy interest in operating systems and an unhealthy interest in Emacs, neither of which he'll cover in this talk.
