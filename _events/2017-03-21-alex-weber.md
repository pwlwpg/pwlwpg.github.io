Folk models are mental models of how things work, shared by many people, that are not necessarily correct. This presentation discuss the susceptibility of humans to the use of folk models. The case of automation-induced complacency will be used as a guiding example to illustrate how folk models (1) substitute one label for another rather than decomposing a large construct into more measurable specifics; (2) are immune to falsification and so resist the most important scientific quality check; and (3) easily get overgeneralised to situations they were never meant to speak about. Alternatives and solutions to these issues will be discussed.
