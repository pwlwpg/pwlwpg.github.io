As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write and to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be reused to reduce future programming costs. The paper to be presented shows that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, can contribute significantly to modularity. As examples, we manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). We conclude that since modularity is the key to successful programming, functional programming offers important advantages for software development.

[Andrew Sinclair](https://twitter.com/Andy_CDandy) enjoys many aspects of Computer Science including algorithms, languages, and programming challenges. He prefers to use a good ol' text editor and regular expressions when they will suffice to solve a problem. While away from the computer, he is often found tabletop gaming and going to user groups. Andrew is passionate about gratuitous use of hotkeys and macros.
